There are a few fixes to aimbot <br/>not working properly.<font size='17'><i><br/>Fix 1 - Instant mode</i></font><font size='15'><br/>If you have the delay setting as 0.5s, set it to instant.<br/>When you need to shoot, press and hold R as long as you would to get a green.<br/>If this does not work, rebind aimbot to a different unused key.<font size='17'><i><br/>Fix 2 - Different GUI</i></font><font size='15'><br/>The Jeff Hoops aimbot was sourced from the tactbacon hoops gui.<br/>Although JH originally used a modded version of the tactbacon method,<br/>it was replaced with the tactbacon version just in case it worked better.<br/>You can get tactbacon from https://pastebin.com/raw/fkvu1Shr</font><font size='17'><i><br/>Fix 3 - Tap</i></font><font size='15'><br/>If you have the delay setting as 0.5s, make sure you aren&apos;t holding R.<br/>Quickly tapping <i>might</i> solve the problem, but in case it doesn&apos;t<br/>rebind the aimbot trigger to another key.</font>
