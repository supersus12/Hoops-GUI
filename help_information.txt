Whenever you use aimbot it sends a <br/>perfect shot event, which go in most of the time.<br/>Although perfect shots are accurate, you can't shoot across the map and<br/>expect it to go in.</font><font size='25'><br/><b>The aimbot won&apos;t work; it&apos;s shooting like normal</b></font><font size='15'><br/>Although this and the &quot;aimbot isn&apos;t going in&quot; problem seem similar,<br/>they are very much different. There are a few fixes to aimbot <br/>not working properly.</font><font size='17'><i><br/>Fix 1 - Instant mode</i></font><font size='15'><br/>If you have the delay setting as 0.5s, set it to instant.<br/>When you need to shoot, press and hold R as long as you would to get a green.<br/>If this does not work, rebind aimbot to a different unused key.</font><font size='17'><i><br/>Fix 2 - Different GUI</i></font><font size='15'><br/>The Jeff Hoops aimbot was sourced from the tactbacon hoops gui.<br/>Although JH originally used a modded version of the tactbacon method,<br/>it was replaced with the tactbacon version just in case it worked better.<br/>You can get tactbacon from https://pastebin.com/raw/fkvu1Shr</font><font size='17'><i><br/>Fix 3 - Tap</i></font><font size='15'><br/>If you have the delay setting as 0.5s, make sure you aren&apos;t holding R.<br/>Quickly tapping <i>might</i> solve the problem, but in case it doesn&apos;t<br/>rebind the aimbot trigger to another key.</font><font size='25'><br/><b>Pass to self doesn&apos;t work</b></font><font size='15'><br/>Pass to self, just like a few other modules, are very<br/>early in development / testing. They are not finished and may not work<br/>properly / as you&apos;d expect.</font><font size='25'><br/><b>Hitbox exp. doesn&apos;t work</b></font><font size='15'><br/>See <i>&quot;Pass to self doesn&apos;t work&quot;</i></font><font size='25'><br/><b>Auto grab doesn&apos;t work</b></font><font size='15'><br/>Auto grab requires an exploit that has compatibility with<br/><i><sc>firetouchinterest()</sc></i>. If you don&apos;t have one,<br/>krnl is a good free exploit that supports it.<br/>If your exploit supports it, make sure you are next to the ball<br/>for a sufficient time, and the ball is not being held by anyone.</font>
